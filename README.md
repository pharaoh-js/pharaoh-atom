## PharaohJS -- Atom Package

This ~~is the reference implementation~~ _will be_ the prototype of Pharaoh, a technology  
for live broadcasting of code from an instructor's editor to a student-accessible, read-only  
client. This repository holds the Atom Package for the instructor. Please see the rest of our  
org for the student client and other related repos.

To get started, install this package with `apm install pharaoh-atom`. When you're ready to  
broadcast, use the `pharoah:start` command. To stop, just use `pharaoh:stop`.
