## Pharaoh -- Atom Package

This is a WIP plugin for [Atom](http://atom.io), to enable live broadcasting of code sessions  
directly from the editor to the [client app](https://github.com/pharaoh-js/pharaoh).

To get started, `git clone https://github.com/pharaoh-js/pharaoh-atom.git`, `cd pharaoh-atom`,  
`npm install`, and `apm link`. When you're ready to broadcast, use `pharoah:start` from the  
command palette. To stop sharing, simply close the pane.

This is very much under development, and development is temporarily paused while we work on a  
[desktop client](https://github.com/pharaoh-js/Pharaoh/tree/electron).

Issues are welcome, and pull requests doubly so!

License: WTFPL. Or DBAD. Or anything you like, really.

Huge thanks to @firebase and @fank for giving us a huge headstart on this, and @atom for the  
great API documentation.
